===================================

Epic attempt to get Spring Boot + MyBatis working with Java Config

This is built on the Spring Boot Profile sample (https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot) to exercise external configuration using yaml.

The goal is to get Spring's Config capabilities to work with MyBatis MapperScanner using Java config + Annotations.

** This now works, hooray! **
